# UFC data analysis

This project is a proof of concept my approach with data science. 


# Analysis

For every fighter between the proposed years we have a median of the years.

The most oldest fighter and with most wins are 'Damian Maia' with 30 years old and the Youngest are 'Dustin Poiri' with 14 wins.
